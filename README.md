## The Connect4 game using ncurses C library
This was a project for my university C programming course.

To test it, you must first install the dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
```

Then clone this repo, build and run the game:
```
git clone http://github.com/badescunicu/connect4 && cd connect4
make build
make run
```
